* Recall the definitions from last time
* If 𝑀 is a finite monoid and 𝑠 one of its elements:
  + 𝑠⁰ = 1 = ⟦λ⟧
  + 𝑠¹ = 𝑠
  + 𝑠ᵏ = 𝑠⁢𝑠ᵏ⁻¹
  + There is some 𝑛 and 𝑚 such that 𝑠ⁿ⁺ᵐ = 𝑠ⁿ
  + The collection of all 𝑠ᵏ is "the submonoid generated by 𝑠"
* Aperiodic monoids
  + For each 𝑠, its generated submonoid ends in a cycle of length one
  + Necessarily finite, and thus regular
  + Equivalent to **generalized regular expressions** without \*
* Regular Expressions
  + Base Cases
    - ∅: ⟦∅⟧ = ∅
    - λ: ⟦λ⟧ = {λ}
    - σ∈Σ: ⟦σ⟧ = {σ}
  + Inductive Cases
    - (R⋅S): ⟦(R⋅S)⟧ = {𝑟⋅𝑠 : 𝑟∈⟦R⟧ and 𝑠∈⟦S⟧}
    - (R+S): ⟦(R+S)⟧ = ⟦R⟧∪⟦S⟧
    - (R\*): ⟦(R+S)⟧ = ⟦R⟧∪⟦S⟧
* Generalized Regular Expressions
  + Include all base cases and inductive cases of regular expressions
  + More Inductive Cases
    - (R&S): ⟦(R&S)⟧ = ⟦R⟧∩⟦S⟧
    - R̄: ⟦R̄⟧ = Σ\*−⟦R⟧
  + No more powerful than standard regular expressions
  + Star-Free expressions forbid the \* operator
  + Σ\* is still definable as ∅̄
* Star-Free and Regular are the most complex classes we'll see here
* At the other extreme: trivial languages!
  + Denoted by 𝟏
  + For a fixed alphabet Σ, there are two languages in 𝟏:
    - ∅
    - Σ\*
* Not a trivial language, but consider the following:<br />
  ![A DFA of four states. States 1, 3, and 4 are accepting.
  State 1 goes to 2 on a, or 4 on b or c.
  State 2 goes to itself on a or c, or to 3 on b.
  State 3 goes to 2 on a or c, or to itself on b.
  State 4 is a sink.](./sa-then-eb.svg)
  + Its syntactic monoid is as follows:<br />
  ![The syntactic monoid of this language.
    States are ⟦λ⟧, ⟦a⟧, ⟦b⟧, ⟦c⟧, and ⟦ab⟧.
    The full table is provided below.](./sa-then-eb-mon.svg)
  + Full table provided below
  + Every element is idempotent: 𝐸(𝑀)=𝑀
  + The semigroup is identical minus ⟦λ⟧, so 𝐸(𝑆)=𝑆
  + We consider 𝑒⁢𝑆⁢𝑒
    - 𝑒⁢𝑆 is everything reachable from 𝑒⁢ in the graph
    - 𝑒⁢𝑆⁢𝑒 is what we get by following 𝑒 again from there
    - See the table below
    - We see 𝑒⁢𝑆⁢𝑒=𝑒, i.e., 𝑒⁢𝑆⁢𝑒∈𝟏 for all idempotent 𝑒
    - This means the language is **locally** trivial, denoted 𝐋𝟏
* 𝐋𝟏 corresponds to Generalized Definite languages
  + Boolean combinations over prefixes and suffixes
  + This example language is ⋊a → b⋉
* If we have a locally-something class, there's a tier-based extension:
  + If there's a symbol that makes a self-loop everywhere, strip it away
  + If what remains is in the class, it's in the tier-based class
* Summary
  + A class 𝐕
  + Has a local extension 𝐋𝐕 where 𝑒⁢𝑆⁢𝑒∈𝐕
  + And that has a tier-based extension 𝐓𝐋𝐕
